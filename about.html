        <p class="kat">I won my first art competition in the 4th grade, went on to show my work in several juried shows and I completed a BFA in illustration & design. My experience ranges from design to marketing with lots of odd jobs in the mix. I thrive in a creative enviornment & enjoy working with like minded individuals.
        </p>
        <p class="kat">Most recently, I've decided to throw myself into the world of programing/web development. I aspire to experience as much as I can as well as continuing to grow and evolve.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="kat"> Outside of work I devote my time to learning poledance, yoga, painting and all things outdoors. I love a challenge and new experiences.</p>
